Centralized Puppet
------------------

```
puppet agent -t --server puppet.mysite.internal'
```

<aside class="notes">

Enough machines and services being managed that it makes sense to build out a
proper Puppet master and attach Puppet agents

  * Systems are continually managed rather than run-off runs
  * Code stored in modules, modules contained in environments
  * Locally developed modules intermixed with modules from the Forge/GitHub
  * Code is still handed in an ad hoc basis
