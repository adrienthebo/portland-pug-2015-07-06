### The Big Picture

<aside class="notes">
  * We've walked across the entire scale of complexity
    * Started with a single user and Puppet apply
    * To a few developers with a few environments
    * To large scale orgs with hundreds of modules
  * Different orgs have different needs
    * All modules stored in the control repo
    * All modules external via the Puppetfile
    * Some mix of the two
