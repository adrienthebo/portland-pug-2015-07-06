The problem space
=================

The hole in the workflow

  * Code is written on development systems
    * Laptops
    * Bastion hosts
  * Code is run on puppet masters/production systems
  * How do we get code from one system to another?

r10k: Puppet code deployment

  * Relies on existing tools for code deployment (Git)
  * Unifies development and production workflows
    * Git branches become Puppet environments
